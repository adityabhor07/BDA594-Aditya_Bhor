1. What are the key functions of GitHub? Who are the users? Please use your own
words to describe them (200 words – 300 words).
- Github is an online website where a group of people can work on the same project without conflicting with each other.Every group member can work on the project by creating their own branch.This ensures that different changes made by different users don't create confusion in the main project.Users can freely make their own changes on the project in their own respective branch and send a commit request.In the main branch, we may choose the best change or commit which will help us in making our project more effective.we can also fix bugs and glitches without harming the main project. 

Github can be used by anyone who is working with a team or by himself on a project.On a personal endeavor, Github can be used to try out different features that we may wish to include in the project without affecting the main branch.In a team environment, it can be used by multiple team members who may be working on the same or different aspects of the project.Github is a great way of collaborating on a task.


2. What are the differences between “clone” and “pull request” in GitHub?
- Clone is used to make a copy of a repository on Github on our own computer.The project that are stored on Github can be transferred to our own PC for working on them by using Clone.

  Pull request is used by users who have made some changes on the project or the code and now they want to add it to the main code.Once you submit a pull request, it may be reviewed and if everything is in order,   can be inferred in the main project.

3.Introduce ONE selected “Data Set” from the [awesome-datascience] GitHub with its
URL and describe its potential applications and values.
-  
        KAGGLE DATASET https://www.kaggle.com/datasets
 Kaggle provides datasets that can be used for multiple purposes.It has datasets that we can use to train a Machine learning model or create a project.It provides a very wide variety of Data.
   I have personally used datasets from Kaggle to train a ML model that predicted whether the image of the brain had Tumor.it can prove very valuable for creating projects.


4. Introduce ONE selected “free-data-science-book” with its URL and author/institute
information. Explain briefly why you are interested in this book.


       Book  :  THE PROMISE AND PERIL OF BIG DATA
       Author:  David Bollier
       URL   :  https://www.aspeninstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/files/content/docs/pubs/The_Promise_and_Peril_of_Big_Data.pdf


    I am interested in this book as it tells us how Big data can be useful and its impact on the world.It also points out challenges faced by this widespread use of Big Data.David Collier also provides some possible solutions to the challenges he poses about Big Data.
